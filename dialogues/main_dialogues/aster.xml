			<Page>Excuse me? How utterly rude! This is no way to talk to an old lady!</Page>
			<Page>Did not even say hello and they want to cut in line. Kids these days!</Page>
			<Page>Back in my time we patiently waited in line like well-behaved nomai. We would even offer our place to our elders.</Page>
			<Page>I remember one day when I was 6, this old gentleman entered the salad shop. Everyone stepped aside and let him order first. That's how polite we were back in the day. The old man didn't even have to pay, the staff was so polite.</Page>
			<Page>The fact he was the owner had nothing to do with it, mind you.</Page>

			<Page>Oh, how I used to love this salad restaurant. Was it the 'Salad Palace'? This old goat certainly spent a lot of days in there.</Page>
			<Page>Their lettuce with cherry tomatoes was truly divine. To this day I wonder how they got their vegetables so ripe.</Page>
			<Page>Was it homegrown, or did they have their special supplier? Youngsters take it for granted nowadays but fresh ingredients really do make a good meal.</Page>
